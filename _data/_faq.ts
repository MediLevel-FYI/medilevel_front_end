    "question": "Who are you?",
    "answer": "We are two technology professionals in Seattle who, through our families and friends, are intimately familiar with the professional culture and compensation practices for providers in the healthcare industry. We have long observed a sharp contrast between the labor practices of healthcare and technology. While technology also has its own struggles and improvement roadmap, we perceive healthcare and hospitals as decades behind modern HR thinking and practice. This project is aimed at providing transparency and data to make the case for broader change."

    "question": "Is this legal?",
    "answer": "Discussing compensation is not only essential but also protected by law. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) safeguards your rights to engage in open conversations about wages, benefits, and working conditions, regardless of whether you are part of a union or not. You have the freedom to share and gather information to promote fairness and transparency in the workplace. To learn more about your rights and the legal protection surrounding discussions of wages, we encourage you to visit the NLRB's informative page: https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/your-rights-to-discuss-wages. Remember, knowledge is power, and together, we can advocate for fair compensation practices."
