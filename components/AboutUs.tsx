          “When I was applying for jobs out of residency, I had to figure out whether anyone I knew was at a practice, then I had to see if they would be willing to provide me any information about how they&apos;re paid. Sharing this information is done so ad-hoc and informally - it&apos;s so hard to understand what my best options are, as far as pay, until I invest a ton of time and hopefully receive an offer.”
